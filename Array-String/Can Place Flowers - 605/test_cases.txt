Example 1:
Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1
Output: true
Explanation: 
- The flowerbed initially looks like: [1, 0, 0, 0, 1].
- One flower can be planted in the second position (index 2), making the flowerbed: [1, 0, 1, 0, 1].
- Since we were able to plant 1 flower, the output is true.

Example 2:
Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2
Output: false
Explanation: 
- The flowerbed initially looks like: [1, 0, 0, 0, 1].
- Only one flower can be planted in the second position (index 2), making the flowerbed: [1, 0, 1, 0, 1].
- Since we need to plant 2 flowers but only 1 can be planted, the output is false.
