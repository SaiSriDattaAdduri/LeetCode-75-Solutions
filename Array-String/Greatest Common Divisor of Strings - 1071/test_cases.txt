Example 1:
Input: str1 = "ABCABC", str2 = "ABC"
Output: "ABC"
Explanation: The greatest common divisor of the strings is "ABC", as both strings can be constructed by repeating "ABC".
str1: ABC ABC
str2: ABC
GCD: ABC

Example 2:
Input: str1 = "ABABAB", str2 = "ABAB"
Output: "AB"
Explanation: The greatest common divisor of the strings is "AB", as both strings can be constructed by repeating "AB".
str1: AB AB AB
str2: AB AB
GCD: AB

Example 3:
Input: str1 = "LEET", str2 = "CODE"
Output: ""
Explanation: The two strings have no common divisor since they cannot be constructed by repeating the same substring.
str1: LEET
str2: CODE
GCD: ""
