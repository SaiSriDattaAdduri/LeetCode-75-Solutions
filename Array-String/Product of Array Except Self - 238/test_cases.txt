Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]
Explanation: 
The product of all elements except the current element for each index is calculated as:
- Index 0: 2 * 3 * 4 = 24
- Index 1: 1 * 3 * 4 = 12
- Index 2: 1 * 2 * 4 = 8
- Index 3: 1 * 2 * 3 = 6

Example 2:
Input: nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]
Output: [0,0,9,0,0]
Explanation: 
The product of all elements except the current element for each index is calculated as:
- Index 0: 1 * 0 * -3 * 3 = 0
- Index 1: -1 * 0 * -3 * 3 = 0
- Index 2: -1 * 1 * -3 * 3 = 9
- Index 3: -1 * 1 * 0 * 3 = 0
- Index 4: -1 * 1 * 0 * -3 = 0
