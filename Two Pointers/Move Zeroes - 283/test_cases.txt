Example 1:
Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]
Explanation: All 0's are moved to the end while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [0]
Output: [0]
Explanation: The array contains only one element, which is 0, so no changes are made.

Example 3:
Input: nums = [1,0,2,0,3,4,0,5]
Output: [1,2,3,4,5,0,0,0]
Explanation: The 0's are moved to the end, and the relative order of non-zero elements is maintained.
